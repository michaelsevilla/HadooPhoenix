HadooPhoenix README

HadooPhoneix is a series of programs that implement scale-out algorithms
on a scale-up system. It also includes sequential, ``dumbest thing possible"
implementations to ensure that we compare scaling architectures, not the
applications themselves. We implement Hadoop algorithms using the Phoenix++
API/runtime.
