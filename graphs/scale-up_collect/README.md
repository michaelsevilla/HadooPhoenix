These directories have scripts that collect system activity report (SAR) binary outputs and produce utilization text files. Note that different versions of SAR produce different binary outputs, so these scripts must be run on the benchmarked system. 

Files
- ./README.md:            this file  
- ./cpu-utilization:      extracts CPU utilizations (user, sys, iowait)
- ./memory-utilization:   extracts memory utilizations (free space, cached space, used space)
- ./swap-utilization:     extracts swap space utiliations

End file
